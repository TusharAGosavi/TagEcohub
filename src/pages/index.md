  title: Why EcoBrew
  description: >
    EcoBrew is the platform for everyone who believes that sustainable living
    shouldn't just feel good, it should do good too. We source all of our
    products directly from small-scale eco-friendly producers and ensure part
    of the profits are reinvested in their communities.

  EcoBrew is the ultimate spot for eco-conscious individuals who want to learn
  about the origin of their products and support the communities that produce them. 
  We take sustainability seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

        We believe that sustainable living has the power to bring people
        together. That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our platform into a
        cozy community space where you can connect with fellow eco-enthusiasts
        and learn about sustainable practices. All of the artwork on display
        there is for sale, with the full price going to the artist.
